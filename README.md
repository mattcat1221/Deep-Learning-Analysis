## Description
Data Preprocessing: The project begins with preprocessing the dataset, which includes handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training a neural network.  Model Architecture: The core of the project is the design and implementation of a deep neural network. The model consists of multiple hidden layers, each with a specified number of nodes and activation functions. The architecture is designed to balance complexity and performance, aiming to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting.  Training the Model: The model is trained on a portion of the dataset (training data) using backpropagation and optimization techniques. The training process involves iteratively adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function, typically using an optimizer like Adam.  Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate portion of the dataset (validation/test data). Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss are used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  Model Export: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it is saved for future use. The model is exported in both the legacy HDF5 format and the newer Keras format, ensuring compatibility with various deployment environments
