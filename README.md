## Description

This project begins with data preprocessing, involving the handling of missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the dataset is properly formatted for training a neural network. The core of the project lies in designing and implementing a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers, each configured with a specific number of nodes and activation functions. The architecture is carefully crafted to balance complexity and performance, aiming for high accuracy while mitigating the risk of overfitting. The model is trained using backpropagation and optimization techniques, such as the Adam optimizer, on a portion of the dataset. The training process iteratively adjusts the model's weights to minimize the loss function. Following training, the model's performance is rigorously evaluated on a separate validation or test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss, which help assess its generalization to unseen data. Once the model demonstrates satisfactory performance, it is saved for future use in both the legacy HDF5 format and the newer Keras format, ensuring broad compatibility across various deployment environments.
